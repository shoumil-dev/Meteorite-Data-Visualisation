<p id="heading">Meteorite Landings on Earth</p>
<p class="intro">Meteorites are space rocks that fall to Earth’s surface. Meteorites are the last stage in the existence of these type of space rocks. Before they were meteorites, the rocks were meteors. Before they were meteors, they were meteoroids. Meteoroids are lumps of rock or metal that orbit the sun. Meteoroids become meteors when they crash into Earth’s atmosphere and the gases surrounding them briefly light up as “shooting stars.” While most meteors burn up and disintegrate in the atmosphere, many of these space rocks reach Earth’s surface in the form of meteorites. Dust-sized particles called micrometeorites make up 99 percent of the approximately 50 tons of space debris that falls on the Earth’s surface every day.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">The data collected is on all the meteorites that have been found or fallen to Earth. 
        The dataset has information on all meteorites from 2013 till a few centuries ago.
        The below visualisation is a representation of some of the heaviest meteorites that have
        fallen on Earth based on their geolocation, and also shows the size category representation
        for each meteorite.</p>

      <h3 class="header">Fallen vs Found Meteorites</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">It is estimated that only 2.42% of meteorites that fall to Earth are ever found. 
        This is because most meteorites fall into the ocean, which covers about 71% of the planet. 
        Additionally, many meteorites fall into remote areas, such as deserts and forests, where they are difficult to find.
        The fact that only 2.42% of meteorites have fallen to Earth, and 97.58% of them have been found is a testament to the dedication and hard work of meteorite hunters and scientists. 
        These individuals have scoured the planet in search of these rare and valuable objects, and they have made significant contributions to our understanding of the solar system.
        This pie chart visualises how few meteorites are actually observed falling from the sky.</p>
