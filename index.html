    <p id="heading">Meteorite Landings on Earth</p>
    <p class="intro">
      Meteorites are space rocks that fall to Earth’s surface. Meteorites are
      the last stage in the existence of these type of space rocks. Before
      they were meteorites, the rocks were meteors. Before they were meteors,
      they were meteoroids. Meteoroids are lumps of rock or metal that orbit
      the sun. Meteoroids become meteors when they crash into Earth’s
      atmosphere and the gases surrounding them briefly light up as “shooting
      stars.” While most meteors burn up and disintegrate in the atmosphere,
      many of these space rocks reach Earth’s surface in the form of
      meteorites. Dust-sized particles called micrometeorites make up 99
      percent of the approximately 50 tons of space debris that falls on the
      Earth’s surface every day.

      Increased awareness of meteorites in the <b>early 1960s</b> was caused by the <b>Apollo program</b> which brought
      meteorites to
      the forefront of public awareness. This was because astronauts brought back <b>lunar</b> meteorites to Earth for
      the
      first time.
      This led to an increase in people <b>reporting</b> meteorites they found, which helped to increase the number of
      meteorites discovered. Additionally, new search techniques like metal detectors and aerial surverys allowed
      finding of meteorites that had been missed in the past. This, coupled with <b>increased funding</b> for meteorite
      research
      and recovery programs led to the massive <b>boom</b> in meteorites discovered in the <b>1970s</b>.

        <h3 class="header">Fallen vs Found Meteorites</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          It is estimated that only <b class="green">2.42%</b> of meteorites that fall to Earth
          are ever found. This is because most meteorites fall into the
          ocean, which covers about <b>71%</b> of the planet. Additionally, many
          meteorites fall into remote areas, such as <b>deserts</b> and <b>forests</b>,
          where they are difficult to find. The fact that only <b class="green">2.42%</b> of
          meteorites have fallen to Earth, and <b class="blue">97.58</b> of them have been
          found is a testament to the dedication and hard work of meteorite
          hunters and scientists. This doughnut chart visualises how <b>few</b> meteorites are actually
          observed <b>falling</b> from the sky.

        <h3 class="header">Meteorites in Oceans vs Land</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          From the doughnut chart, we can see that <b class="brown">83.73%</b> of meteorites are found on land,
          compared to a significantly smaller <b class="blue">16.27%</b> in the world's oceans. This is likely due to
          the
          fact that less than <b>5%</b> of the ocean floor has been mapped. So it is likely that there are
          many still <b>lying on the seabed</b> waiting to be discovered. Additionally, meteorites in the ocean
          are more <b>difficult to spot</b>, blending in with the water and the seabed,
          causing many smaller meteorites to go <b>unnoticed</b>.

    <h3 class="header">Meteorites Discovered Over Time</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
      From the data, we can see that the number of meteorites discovered in recent times is <b>significantly higher</b>
      than in
      previous years. This trend can be attributed to the massive <b>advancements in technology</b>, making it
      substantially
      <b>easier</b> to locate and document meteorites that have reached the Earth's surface. The proliferation of
      <b>high resolution smartphones, cameras</b> with GPS capabilities, and easy access to the internet has empowered
      <b>amateur astronomers</b> and <b>meteorite enthusiasts</b> to quickly capture and share meteorite falls or finds.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Another critical factor is the <b>size</b> of the meteorites in question. Smaller meteorites, which are more
      <b>numerous</b>
      than their larger counterparts, could have easily gone <b>unnoticed</b> or <b>lost</b> to the passage of time,
      never to be
      recorded. It is only in recent years, with the <b>increasing awareness</b> of these smaller meteorites and more
      effective
      search methods, that we've started to capture a more comprehensive picture of the meteorite population on Earth.

      <!-- Recclass Visualisation -->
      <h3 class="header">What are the Types of Meteorite Classes?</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Analyzing <b>recclass</b> data for meteorites over the years provides valuable insights into the
        <b>composition</b> and
        <b>diversity</b> of extraterrestrial materials that have reached Earth. The recclass classification system
        categorizes
        meteorites based on their <b>mineralogical and chemical characteristics</b>, offering a comprehensive
        understanding of
        their origins and formation processes. By tracking changes in recclass data over time, scientists can uncover
        trends in meteorite <b>composition</b>, identify rare or unusual meteorite types, and gain insights into the
        dynamic
        <b>processes</b> occurring in the solar system.
